# Trips -- MEAN stack
 
## Idea

An app that stores useful information about trips to different destinations.

There is a public part - Home page - when user is not registered or logged in, when logged in he/she is redirected to the homepage. If user wants to go to Trips when not logged in- he/she is redirected to login form. when User is logged in he/she has access to trips list. Logged in user can:create trip
User that already created trip can: edit trip, delete trip. If the creator of the trip isn't the current logged in user he/she can only see details about the trip.
